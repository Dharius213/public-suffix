### Third Party Diffusion ###
The Public Suffix List is incorporated for a number of uses, and the project does not prescribe how it is or is not used.

One use case that has evolved which places increasing burden on the volunteer PSL maintainers is where some providers point to the PSL as being a place to get included in order to add or change functionality within their systems.

This third party diffusion includes, in some cases, where the presence or absence of entries is used to point customer requests to an external party in order to keep an elegant customer service FAQ flow.

In every case, the most appropriate solution to issues such as those that point towards having entries in the PSL should first be resolved with the referring party, as utilizing the PSL as a workaround for engineered limits likely sidesteps important security or other intentional concerns that fed the logic to have those limits.
