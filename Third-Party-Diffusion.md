### Third Party Diffusion ###
The Public Suffix List is incorporated for a number of uses, and the project does not prescribe how it is or is not used.

One use case that has evolved which places increasing burden on the volunteer PSL maintainers is where some providers point to the PSL as being a place to get included in order to add or change functionality within their systems.

This third party diffusion includes, in some cases, where the presence or absence of entries is leveraged by companies to point customer requests away to an external party in order to keep their own support or customer flow simplified.  

## A special note to operating systems, social media giants, and other companies, projects or vendors who do this or are contemplating doing this:

# Don't.  

Instead, address your customers directly.  While referring folks away may make for a simple tickbox next to done for your project or elegant customer service FAQ flow for you or your company, it dumps irritated folks who are affected onto the volunteers that help maintain this project.  It should go without mention that it is inappropriate to do so, but mention it we must.

In every case, the most appropriate solution to issues such as those that point towards having entries in the PSL should first be resolved with the referring party, as utilizing the PSL as a workaround for engineered limits likely sidesteps important security or other intentional concerns that fed the logic to have those limits.
