Updates can be filed as either pull requests or issues, at the submitter's preference. Patches often need to be tweaked, so a pull request is not necessarily better.

Submissions are discussed either in the issue or in the pull request.

##Request Authentication##

###ICANN Domains###

Changes here need to either come from a representative of the registry (authenticated in a similar manner to below) or be from public sources such as a registry website.

###Private Domains###

We need to confirm that the person submitting the request is an authorized representative of the domain owner. There are a number of ways to do this; confirming they have a sane-looking email at the domain is one way. If their Github account has their email address visible, that will work as an ownership check. Otherwise, you need to email them and get an affirming response. If their email address is not visible in their profile, it may nonetheless be in their patch.

##Approval##

All submissions need r=gerv before checkin.
