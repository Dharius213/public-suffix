### ICANN Security and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC)
ICANN has a [Security and Stability Advisory Committee](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/ssac-role-2018-02-06-en), with the role of advising the ICANN community and Board on matters relating to the security and integrity of the Internet's naming and address allocation systems.

They created a working group which convened 2014-2015 to review the use of Public Suffix Lists, and how to impliment them within software, in security, and in language libraries and other systems.  This ultimately resulted in SAC070, an advisory on the use of Public Suffix Lists.

Although it is slightly dated and not current and entirely applicable to the Mozilla PSL, it does contain good practices and advise.  Please familiarize yourself with their findings and consider them in your use of these lists.

### ICANN Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO)
The ICANN OCTO team published a guide for TLD Administrators regarding the Public Suffix List, which is helpful reading that includes actions that TLD Administrators should consider with respect to the Universal Acceptance and the impacts and benefits of monitoring the PSL and maintaining current records.
